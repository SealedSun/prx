<p>
I'm close to reaching my first milestone: Support for all common language constructs. What do I mean by &quot;common&quot;? The minimum requirements for the language to be useful if you want.</p>

<p>With the recent addition of commands, the virtual machine is now complete and waits for the compiler and type system to catch up.The <code>foreach</code>loop is ready to be used and accepts both <strong>Prexonite Lists</strong> (mixed values) and pure CLI IEnumerables.
Also built into my current version is support for global code\* and build blocks\*\*.</p>
<h3>Global code</h3>
<p>Allows you to initialize (and re-initialize) global variables.
Those instructions are executed the next time a function is run.
</p>
<h3>Build block</h3>
<p>Introduced by the <code>build</code>keyword.
It gives you control over the loader <strong>at compile time</strong>. You can use the special commands <em>Add</em> and <em>Require</em> to load additional files into the current application. (<em>Require</em> only loads a file if it hasn't been loaded before.)</p>

<p>Here I first compiled the script samples\\beer_fancy.pxs into the file beer.pxs, then loaded that file in an interactive session and finally executed the song function with a custom argument. 
All text output is exclusively generated by Prexonite code. (Yes, this also includes the interactive interface).
