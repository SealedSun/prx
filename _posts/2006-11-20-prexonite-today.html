This is a translation of the german article posted at FrozenHand.A bit more than 4 months later I may still not have a prototype I could release. What I have is a working type system, an assembler and parts of the compiler and the AST/code generator.First I had a closer look at the ANTLR parser generator from the Java domain. ANTLR would have come with it's own IDE and even automatically created an AST. Unfortunately the C# version was not working at that time, so I had to continue my search.<!--more-->With <a href="http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Projects/Coco/#CS">Coco/R</a> I have found an appropriate generator and am already using it successfully.Pros:<ul><li>Generates both scanner and parser</li><li>Uses a top-down algorithm and thus easy to understand and debug</li><li>There is no separate runtime, all the logic is being generated</li><li>Licensed under the GPL</li><li>Automatic error management and recovery (very basic)</li></ul>Cons:<ul><li>Total violation of .NET naming conventions</li><li>Generated files and classes are always named "Parser" / "Scanner" ( + ".cs")</li><li>Exceptions have to be manually translated into "errors"</li><li>No way to customize automatically generated error messages</li><li>No IDE integration</li></ul>Especially the last point, the lack of IDE integration, results in an annoying <em>scroll orgy</em> after a certain grammar size has been reached (Grammars, even context free ones, are not 1-dimensional constructs. One production can be referenced by multiple others.). In <em>C#</em> you can partition your code using <em>#region</em> directives. The <em>Attributed Grammar</em> language (<em>*.atg</em>) does not know such a concept.I am trying to find out whether splitting the grammar up into multiple files will reduce the mess. At the same time I have integrated the invocation of the parser generator into the build process by using MSBuild. All I have to do is to press Compile and PxCoco/R (my custom version of Coco/R) does it's work. Should the *.atg file contains errors, Visual Studio 2005 will treat them like every C# error: They are listed in the errors tab and double clicking on them will send you to the exact position in the grammar file, where the error has been reported.A mapping between the embedded C# code in the grammar file and the generated output would be even more useful. Currently, if the C# compiler detects an error in the generated output, you will have to look at the surrounding function, then switch over to the grammar definition and find the corresponding production.Feature Update<ul><li>More compiler optimizations</li><li>! and ? will <strong>not </strong>be part of identifiers but typecast and inline condition operators, ...</li><li>... instead you can use  as part of identifiers</li><li>One file format (*.pxs) for scripts, compiled applications and build instructions, at the same time</li><li>No namespaces for now</li><li>User types will not be part of the initial releases but are definitely planned</li></ul>
