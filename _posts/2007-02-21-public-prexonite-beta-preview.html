<p>Here it comes, the first public distribution of Prexonite. I call it a "beta preview" as it is no longer in alpha state (all major features are working; at least all unit tests pass.) but there is <em>little to no documentation</em>. 
I'm still working on both the API and the language reference.
</p>
<p>
The preview consists of two *.zip archives: 
The <strong>sources</strong>(including unit tests and all dependencies) and pre-compiled <strong>binaries</strong> of the runtime (Prexonite.dll) and the standalone host (Prx.exe).</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/downloads/SealedSun/prx/Prexonite_beta_preview_1_src.zip" title="Prexonite Beta Preview 1 Sources">Prexonite Beta Preview 1 - Source Code (*.zip)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/downloads/SealedSun/prx/Prexonite_beta_preview_1_bin.zip" title="Prexonite Beta Preview 1 Binaries">Prexonite Beta Preview 1 - Binary ( *.zip)</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Ah, and by "<em>little to no documentation</em>" I mean partial (20%) XML documentation. Heck I don't even have a readme.txt. If you have any questions, please ask (through comments or using the e-mail address in the LICENSE.txt file) me.</p>
