This folder contains the complete Prexonite Script File grammar, divided into several files. 
Since PxCoco (the compiler-compiler) cannot work on multiple files, these grammar fragments 
are assembled into a file called \Prexonite\Prexonite__gen.atg which is then passed to PxCoco. 
So if you want to modify the grammar, do so in the original files here and not the generated one.

The generated parser has a code-behind file called Compiler\Parser.Code.cs.
