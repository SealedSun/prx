layout: page
title: 404 &mdash; Page not found

USAGE: 
GitHub requires the 404 page to be a plain HTML page, not generated by Jekyll.
So every time something about the layout changes, you need to manually re-generate the 404.html page
and save it as /404.html.

Step 1:   Delete the old 404.html
                   THIS IS IMPORTANT!
              If you don't delete that page, it will be served instead of generated by Jekyll
Step 2:   Generate the page by browsing to 
                  http://localhost:4000/404.html
              while the Jekyll server is running, or by committing to GitHub (including the deletion of 404.html)
Step 3:   Save page as 404.html and commit
